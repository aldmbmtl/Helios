# 🚀 Helios

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Helios provides base images for multiple key Linux distributions, optimized to be as small as possible to:

- Reduce pull times  
- Minimize the attack surface  
- Lower data transfer costs  

These images are lightweight, efficient, and ready to use across environments like Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

Some key points about Helios:

- **Base Images**: Designed as base images for Kasm-compatible deployments.  
- **Extremely Minimal Desktops**: Images are intentionally minimal; avoid adding software directly. Instead, extend via the `FROM` instruction in your Dockerfile.

## 🏷️ Versioning

Helios uses its own versioning scheme independent of the underlying distro versions. The format is: `v0.0.0-codename` where `codename` represents the underlying distro. This allows tracking Helios changes separately from distro updates.

### Examples

| Helios Version    | Distro               |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| `v0.0.0-bookworm` | Debian 12 (Bookworm) |

## Usage

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the Helios container. The following environment variables are available:

| Name          | Value                                                                             | Required |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| USER          | Name of the user                                                                  | X        |
| UID           | POSIX compliant uid for the user                                                  | X        |
| GID           | POSIX compliant gid for the user                                                  |          |
| PASSWORD      | Password set for the user                                                         |          |
| IDLE_TIME     | Trigger the idle hook after x time                                                |          |
| DESKTOP_FILES | Paths seperated by ":". For example, `/some/path/1/*.desktop:/some/*/2/*.desktop` |          |

> [!CAUTION]
> Desktop file scraping isn't supported in Alpine Linux.

> [!TIP]  
> The `GID` will match the `UID` if not specified.

> [!TIP]  
> The `UID` and `GID` are NOT the user that is launching and running the container. 
> Because of s6, the container always starts and runs as root. It then uses s6 to run the desktop using the specified 
> user using those environment variables. This is done to ensure that the desktop has the correct permissions and 
> ownership on things like the home directory and other files. This helps with things like Network Shares as well.

> [!CAUTION]
> Helios DOES NOT provide any authentication for connecting to the workstation. This means that anyone who can
> connect to the http endpoint can access the desktop as that user. For proper security, we recommend using a 
> reverse proxy with authentication in front of Helios. This can be done using Nginx, Traefik, or any other 
> reverse proxy that supports authentication.
> 
> Security is a very important part of any deployment and it isn't a one size fits all solution. Instead of shipping
> Helios with a specific authentication method, we leave it up to the user to implement their own security measures
> that best fit their deployment. This allows for more flexibility and customization in how Helios is used.

### Ports

Helios exposes the following ports:

| Port | Description       |
|------|-------------------|
| 3000 | HTTP Desktop Port |

### Deployment

Helios is meant to be launched in a number of different ways. It works as a standalone docker container as well as being
k8s ready. The following examples show how to run Helios in different environments.


#### Docker
You can run Helios in a Docker container using the following command:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name helios \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e USER=bob \
  -e UID=1000 \
  helios:v0.0.0-noble
``` 

#### Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose to run Helios. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
   helios:
      image: helios:v0.0.0-noble
      hostname: "helios"
      container_name: helios
      environment:
         - USER=helios
         - UID=1000
      ports:
         - "3000:3000"
```

#### Kubernetes

You can run Helios in a Kubernetes cluster using the following manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
   name: helios
spec:
   serviceName: helios
   replicas: 1
   selector:
      matchLabels:
         app: helios
   template:
      metadata:
         labels:
            app: helios
      spec:
         containers:
            - name: helios
              image: helios:v0.0.0-noble
              ports:
                 - containerPort: 3000
              env:
                 - name: USER
                   value: "helios"
                 - name: UID
                   value: "1000"
```

## Customizing Helios


### 📦 Unified Package Management

To streamline cross-distro package management, Helios uses a centralized `packages.yaml` system. This allows each logical package to be mapped to its appropriate name for each Linux distribution, while also enabling distros to inherit shared definitions from one or more package groups.

---

#### 🔧 Structure of `packages.yaml`

##### `packages` Section

Each item in the `packages` array defines a **single logical package**, and includes distro-specific keys for the corresponding package names:

```yaml
packages:
  - debian: mesa-va-drivers        # VA-API support for Debian
    rhel: mesa-va-drivers          # Same package name for RHEL
    alpine: mesa-va-gallium        # Different package name for Alpine

  - debian: libx11-6
    rhel: libX11
    alpine: libx11

  - debian: extra-debian-only-pkg
```

This format enables clean mapping between distros for the same logical dependency, and avoids repeating similar entries in multiple places.

##### `inherit` Section

This section defines which **groups of package mappings** each distro should inherit from.

```yaml
inherit:
  ubuntu:
    - common
    - debian
  alpine:
    - common
  debian:
    - common
  rhel:
    - common
```

In this example:

- **Ubuntu** inherits all packages defined under the `common` and `debian` groups.
- **RHEL**, **Debian**, and **Alpine** all inherit from the `common` group.
- Each distro may also have its own explicitly defined packages.

---

#### 📤 Package List Generation

A preprocessing step flattens the data into a list of distro-specific packages, combining:

1. All package mappings from the inherited groups
2. Any mappings explicitly defined for that distro

Each distro’s final list is saved as:

```
/tmp/lists/<distro>.list
```

For example, `/tmp/lists/ubuntu.list` will include packages from:
- The `common` group
- The `debian` group
- Any Ubuntu-specific entries (if present)

---

#### 🧱 Build Integration

These generated lists are used directly in the image build process. Example from [`alma-9/build/system.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juno-fx/Helios/refs/heads/48-unify-package-list-clean/alma-9/build/system.sh):

```bash
dnf install -y --allowerasing --setopt=install_weak_deps=False --best \
  $(cat /tmp/lists/rhel.list) \
  fastfetch
```

This example installs the complete set of packages for a RHEL-based image (including inherited packages from `common`).

---

#### ✅ Benefits

- 🔄 **Cross-distro compatibility**: One source of truth for logical packages across platforms
- 🔧 **Easier maintenance**: Update a single YAML file instead of multiple build scripts
- ♻️ **Reusability**: Define shared groups (`common`, `debian`, etc.) and reuse across distros
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Final package lists are explicitly generated and easy to inspect

---

### 🏗️ Using `FROM`

Helios images can be used as a base in your own Dockerfiles with the `FROM` instruction.

For example, to build on top of the Ubuntu 24.04 Helios image:

```dockerfile
FROM helios:v0.0.0-noble

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y htop
```

You can then push your custom image to a private registry and deploy it in Kasm-compatible environments.

---

#### ✅ Benefits

- 🚀 **Quick Start**: Leverage prebuilt, tested base images to speed up your container builds.
- 🔄 **Consistency**: Builds start from a known, reliable foundation, reducing surprises.
- 🔧 **Customizability**: Easily extend Helios images to fit your specific application or environment needs.
- 📦 **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate with Kasm and other container orchestration platforms.

---

### ⚙️ Event Hooks

Helios uses the [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) init system from [just-containers](https://github.com/just-containers).  
This allows us to hook into the container boot sequence to run custom scripts and services. The design is heavily inspired by the excellent work from [Linuxserver IO](https://www.linuxserver.io/).

> [!TIP]  
> The init hook executes **before** the user environment is fully set up, but you have full access to environment variables and the filesystem.

---

#### 🛠️ Custom Services

Custom services are managed through the `/etc/helios/services.d` directory. You can add your own by either:

- Overriding `/etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh` in your Dockerfile  
- Mounting your scripts into the container

These services will run in the background as part of the container lifecycle.

---

#### 🏗️ Using `FROM`

You can extend Helios images by adding your custom init scripts and services in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM helios:v0.0.0-noble

# Custom init script
COPY ./my-custom-init.sh /etc/helios/init.d/my-custom-init.sh

# Custom service
COPY ./my-custom-service.sh /etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh

# Custom idle script
COPY ./my-custom-idle.sh /etc/helios/idle.d/custom.sh
```

---

#### 🔌 Mounting Scripts Dynamically

Alternatively, mount scripts at runtime via Docker or Kubernetes volume mounts. This lets you add or update scripts without rebuilding the image — great for development and testing.

Example Docker run command:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name my-helios-container \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-init.sh:/etc/helios/init.d/my-custom-init.sh \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-service.sh:/etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-idle.sh:/etc/helios/idle.d/custom.sh \
  helios:v0.0.0-noble
```

Example Kubernetes ConfigMap and Deployment snippet to mount the scripts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-helios-config
data:
  my-custom-idle.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Helios has hit the idle timeout!"
  
  my-custom-init.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello from my custom init script!"
  
  my-custom-service.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash

    set -e

    echo
    echo "Helios Custom Service Initialization"
    echo
    /path/to/my/custom/script.sh
    /path/to/my/other/custom/script.sh
    sleep infinity
